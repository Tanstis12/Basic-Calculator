# Basic-Calculator
# 🧮 Arithmetic Calculator (Python)

A beginner-friendly Python calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (+, –, ×, ÷) based on user input. Designed to reinforce core programming concepts including user input handling, type casting, conditional logic, and formatted output.

## 🚀 Features
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Interactive prompts for operator and numbers
- Rounds results to two decimal places for clarity
- Error message for invalid operators

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Types**: float (numbers), string (operator)
- **Type Casting**: converting input to float
- **Conditional Logic**: `if/elif/else` structure
- **User Input Handling**: interactive prompts and validation
- **Output Formatting**: clean results using `round()` and `f-strings`

## 📦 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/arithmetic-calculator.git
## Example
   Enter an operator (+ - * /): *
Enter the first number: 4.5
Enter the second number: 2
9.0

🛠️ Future Improvements- Add support for exponentiation and modulus
- Include input validation for non-numeric entries
- Allow multiple calculations in one session using loops
- Modularize with reusable functions
